      <p>
        The origin of pain au chocolat is not utterly clear; there are many
        different theories about who came up with the idea of wrapping a
        chocolate stick with a laminated dough. The most popular one holds that
        it was an Austrian military official, August Zang, who imported them
        from Austria to France back in the 1830s. According to this theory, in
        his Viennese Bakery in Paris he would have baked Schokoladencroissants
        (croissants filled with chocolate). However, the French food historian
        Jim Chevallier, who published a book about Zang and the origin of the
        croissant, states that this may not be entirely true, since the
        denomination ‚Äúcroissant‚Äù came after Zang made the Kipferl (Austria‚Äôs
        original croissants)popular in France. It seems that for the time being
        the true origin will remain shrouded in mystery‚Ä¶
